# Mini Website

### Demonstrating HTML, CSS and Bootstrap


* Description of Task  
  * This task was focused around implementing 10 different features across multiple pages whilst practicing git workflow.
  * I created as much as the website as possible using separate branches for each feature however sometimes found myself forgetting to create new branches when I'd merged with dev.
  * I created all my branches from my dev branch and always merged after I had completed a feature


* The following features were required and have been shown on my website in various places.

  1. Navbar (every page)

  2. Jumbotron (ever page)

  3. Lists (home & recipe page)

  4. Tables (recipe page)

  5. Image gallery (home page)

  6. Videos (NOT embedding from YouTube, Vimeo etc) (video guides page)

  7. Carousel (food showcase page)

  8. Pagination OR Modal (pagination is viewable on the nav bar)

  9. Profile section (photo, name, job title, descriptin etc.) (aboutme page available from the footer)

  10. Footer with common links (eg. Sitemap) (footer that contains links)



* To view the test site that has been created, navigate to folder in terminal and `open index.html`.  This will open the page on the home page and will allow you to navigate through the website using the navigation bar and the footer links (only `About Me` works)

* To view the code in atom, use terminal to navigate to the folder and type the `atom .` command.  This will open the entire folder content in atom and you will be able to view each file within atom.

As @NBurns90 said:
> This task has allowed me to really learn and use bootstrap to it's potential.  I believe I have a solid grasp on overriding bootstrap css.  There is plenty more that I could do to this website and I would like to continue developing this over time as I can use it for my own personal use.
